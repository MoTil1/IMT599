<main>
    <p>This page contains some of the most common questions regarding the ElectionGuard software and how elections work when ElectionGuard is implemented.</p>
    <p><b>Can I check who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?</b></p>
    <p><b>No.</b> The site will only display whether your vote was correctly tallied in the election. For security purposes, actual votes have no way of being displayed after they have been cast.</p>
    <p><b>Can others see who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?</b></p>
    <p><b>No.</b> No one, including the person who submitted their cast ballot can see the contents after it has been cast.</p>
    <p><b>Is my name attached to the verification code feature?</b></p>
    <p><b>No.</b> Verification codes are anonymous and encrypted. Names are never displayed on confirmation codes.</p>
    <p><b>How long does it take to verify a/my ballot?</b></p>
    <p>For machine-read ballots where bubbles are filled in- <b>up to 7 days after they are cast</b></p>
    <p>For hand-written ballots- <b>up to 2 weeks after they are cast</b></p>
    <p><b>What does my verification status mean?</b></p>
    <p><b>Received</b> - This status means that your ballot was received but not yet verified</p>
    <p><b>Verified</b> - This status indicates your vote was received, correctly counted, and verified</p>
    <p><b>Spoiled</b> - This status indicates that this ballot was not officially cast, and the contents of the ballot are available to be seen</p>
    <p><b>Can someone find out who I am from a spoiled ballot?</b></p>
    <p><b>Absolutely Not.</b> All ballots whether they are cast or spoiled do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and are fully encrypted.</p>
