## Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains some of the most common questions regarding the ElectionGuard software and how elections work when ElectionGuard is implemented.

## Can I check who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?

<b>No.</b> The site will only display whether your vote was correctly tallied in the election. For security purposes, actual votes have no way of being displayed after they have been cast.

## Can others see who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?

<b>No.</b> No one, including the person who submitted their cast ballot can see the contents after it has been cast.

## Is my name attached to the verification code feature?

<b>No.</b> Verification codes are anonymous and encrypted. Names are never displayed on confirmation codes.

## What does my verification status mean?

<b>Cast</b> - This status means that your ballot was received and is part of the election record.

<b>Spoiled</b> - This status indicates that this ballot was not officially cast, was spoiled, and the contents of the ballot are available to be seen

## Can someone find out who I am from a spoiled ballot?

<b>Absolutely Not.</b> All ballots whether they are cast or spoiled do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and are fully encrypted.
